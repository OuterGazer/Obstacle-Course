This game is based on the first section of the GameDev.tv Unity 3D course.

My original implementations are:
- Player moves a ball instead of a cube.
- Instead of direct control through arrow keys, players control the ground's inclination angle with the mouse movement. The ball moves appropriately in response.
- Original obstacles like slopes, horizontal windmills and pendulum cubes.
- A basic UI for gameplay and control explanations.
- A timer to keep track of how long does it take for the player to control the level.
- Expanded the controls to include pressing R for restarting the level, P to pause/unpause and Esc to quit.
