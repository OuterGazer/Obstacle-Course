# Obstacle-Course
A casual 3D game consisting on moving a ball towards the finish line while trying to avoid the obstacles on the way.

This game is based on the first section of the GameDev.tv Unity 3D course.
My original implementations are:
- Player moves a ball instead of a cube.
- Instead of direct control through arrow keys, players control the ground's inclination angle with the mouse movement. The ball moves appropriately in response.
- Original obstacles like slopes, horizontal windmills and pendulum cubes.
- A basic UI for gameplay and control explanations.
- A timer to keep track of how long does it take for the player to control the level.
- Expanded the controls to include pressing R for restarting the level, P to pause/unpause and Esc to quit.
